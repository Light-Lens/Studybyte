I'm currently developing search engine named Cpix, which may have the potential to give Google a some-what nice competition, but that's not what we are talking about. Studybyte's most of the search algorithm is taken from Cpix, and that saved me a lot of time to setup the whole search system. This means that Studybyte will not take 3-4 years, Instead it will be finished in like almost 4-5 months which is a really great news!

Studybyte will always be in developement, obviously as every software is in, but as Study material changes over time the Search Algorithm for Studybyte must have to get changed with time so that it can be relevant in the market.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one). Note that VSCode is only needed if you want to develope Studybyte.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Studybyte`.

## Why To Use Studybyte?
That's a pretty good question though!

Studybyte is optimized to list you Study related content on it's search results, meaning if you search something like "How to make a Cake" then Studybyte will not give you any results, instead it will redirect to the error page saying "We didn't find any match for your search term(s)". And all the links that will get listed your result page will be only coming from trusted sources, so you don't need to worry about anything.

I don't know whether others have experienced this or not but some times i need to perform almost 3-4 Google searches to find the solution i'm actually looking for. Now obviously Google is a really big and fast search engine, but as we know even Google is not perfect. But i think at this case Studybyte is in lead, i know i can't compete with Google because it's a really huge company and i'm an individual creator, but i think that this search engine can help people a lot more than Google.

### What about Features?
There are not so many features implemented yet, but we are currently working on it.
- Studybyte is optimized to only provide Study material on it's search results.
- Search Tags

and a bit more.

### What are Search Tags?
Well Search Tags is nothing much, it's just some keywords, if at the start of your Query you use Search Tags then you can perform a search to Google, YouTube or etc.

Currently implemented Search Tags are:
- Search to Google using `g?`
- Search to YouTube using `yt?`

in the future more will be added.

## Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine.
- Google Chrome (or any other Web Browser, but it must be Up-To-Date and Javascript must be enabled)
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)

NOTE: These requirments are only needed if you want to develope Studybyte.
