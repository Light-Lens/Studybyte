I'm currently developing search engine named Cpix, which may have the potential to give Google a some-what nice competition, but that's not what we are talking about. Studybyte's most of the search algorithm is taken from Cpix, and that saved me a lot of time to setup the whole search system. This means that Studybyte will not take 3-4 years like Cpix to get completed. Instead it will be finished in like almost 6-7 months which is a really great news!

Studybyte will always be in developement, obviously as every software is in, but as Study material changes over time the Search Algorithm for Studybyte must have to get changed with the time so that it can be relevant in the market.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one). Note that VSCode is only needed if you want to develope Studybyte.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Studybyte`.

## Why To Use Studybyte?
That's a pretty good question, well as Studybyte is only optimized to find Study materials from trusted sources. You can find your desired content really quickly and you don't have to do 3-4 Google searches to find the perfect solution. Now obviously I can't compete with Google because it's a really huge company and i'm an individual creator, but i think that this search engine can help a lot of people. And Studybyte has the potential to achive success.

## Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine.
