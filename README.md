# Studybyte
Studybyte is a Search Engine completely developed from scratch to help Students, find Study material easily on the Internet.

***Note:- The search algorithm for Studybyte isn't completed yet, so there are a few bugs and missing features, which will be fixed very soon.***

I'm currently developing search engine named Cpix, which may have the potential to give Google a some-what nice competition, but that's not what we are talking about. Studybyte's most of the search algorithm is taken from Cpix, and that saved me a lot of time to setup the whole search system. This means that Studybyte will not take 3-4 years, Instead it will be finished in like almost 4-5 months which is a really great news!

Studybyte will always be in developement, obviously as every software is in, but as Study material changes over time, the Search Algorithm for Studybyte must have to get changed with time so that it can be relevant in the market.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one). Note that VSCode is only needed if you want to develope Studybyte.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Studybyte`.

## Why To Use Studybyte?
That's a pretty good question though!

Studybyte is optimized to list you Study related content on it's search results, meaning if you search something like "How to make a Cake" then Studybyte will not give you any results, instead it will redirect to the error page saying "We didn't find any match for your search term(s)". And all the links that will get listed on your results page will only be coming from trusted sources, so you don't need to worry about anything.

I don't know whether others have experienced this or not but some times i need to perform almost 3-4 Google searches to find the solution i'm actually looking for. Now obviously Google is a really big and fast search engine, but as we know even Google is not perfect. But i think at this case Studybyte is in lead, i know i can't compete with Google because it's a really huge company and i'm an individual creator, but i think that this search engine can help people a lot more than Google does.

Studybyte has a lot of features for you all, and one of them are Search Tags. Well Search Tags are nothing much, they are some keywords to use in Studybyte, if at the start of your Query you use any Search Tag then you can perform a search to any search engine like Google, YouTube or etc.

Currently implemented Search Tags are:
- Search to Google using `g?`
- Search to YouTube using `yt?`

## Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine.
- Google Chrome (or any other Web Browser, but it must be Up-To-Date and Javascript must be enabled)
- Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)

NOTE: These requirments are only needed if you want to develope Studybyte.
