# Studybyte
Studybyte is a Search Engine completely developed from scratch to help Students, find Study material easily on the Internet.

I'm currently developing search engine named Cpix, which may have the potential to give Google a some-what nice competition, but that's not what we are talking about. Studybyte's most of the search algorithm is taken from Cpix. This is because it's saved me a lot of time to actually setup the whole search system and this means that Studybyte will not take 3-4 years to get completed. Instead it's will be finished in like almost 6-7 months which is really great!

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended (You can use your desired one). Note that VSCode is only needed if you want to develope Studybyte.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Studybyte`.

## Why To Use Studybyte?
That's a pretty good question, well as Studybyte is only optimized to find Study materials from trusted sources. You can find your desired content really quickly and you don't have to do 3-4 Google searches to find the perfect solution. Now obviously I can't compete with Google because it's a really huge company and i'm an individual creator, but i think that this search engine can help a lot of people. And Studybyte has the potential to achive success.
